User login & Registration setup using JSP, Servlet, JDBC in eclipse and Tomcat
Server. 
I will create a user Registration form & Login using JSP. On submitting the form
control goes to a servlet. 
The servlet calls the class function, that further communicates with 
the MYSQL database using JDBC. And the user registration data is inserted into the 
database.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
### 🔏 Registration-form 
- In Registration form, we will have a form to fill all the details which will contain 
name, username, password, address, contact number, etc.
This form will help us to register with the application. They take all our details and 
store it in a database.

### ✍ which has the following fields:
1. Name
2. E mail
3. Password
4. Repeat Password
5. Contact Number

   - After filling all these details we have Register button, on click of that button all the details
will be stored In MYSQL Database.
### 🔐 Login and logout form
- Like registration form we will have a login and logout form. In this example, we have 
taken Login form where we have two fields “username” and “password” with a submit 
button.

-  When we click on submit button then we get welcome message with a logout button.

-  When we click on logout button then we get back to login form

- To perform login and registration with JSP and MySQL with practices that will show 
you, how to create java application and connect it with MSQL a database. or an idea for java 
database connectivity (JDBC) with MySQL
